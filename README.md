# jsdatatable
A simple pure javascript table generation script. I built this for a interview challenge but am going to keep improving and maintaining this. 

Currently does the following functionality:

1. Sorting
2. Searching
3. Paginating
4. Show/Hide Columns

#TODO:

1. Make columns generic based on table headers
2. Improve searching and table reconstruction
3. Improve logic for sorting when dataset is large
